# 8
It tells you the number 8 ...Not 7, Not 9, but precisely 8!

Inspired by the profound revelations and delightful futility of The Stanley Parable, an app was lovingly handcrafted using the Flet library on Python. "Handcrafted" might be a strong word, as it suggests a degree of intentionality that frankly, me, are still trying to ascertain. It's a truly colossal 40MB in size, Indeed, it's so grand, it's even bigger than what GitHub allows you to upload directly through browser!, a testament not to groundbreaking features or breathtaking graphics, but to the sheer, unadulterated something packed within its digital walls.

This digital behemoth stands as a monument to the principle of... well, Absolutely Nothing! A towering achievement in negative space, a testament to the fact that you can make something quite large out of very little. I could have optimized, certainly. I could have made it a few kilobytes. But where's the artistic integrity in efficiency? Where's the existential dread in a small download, especially in this glorious age of 5G, not 56kb dial-up. A single, solitary button. A beacon. A symbol. A glorious testament to the human advance in automated machinery control, reduced to its purest, most distilled form. You'll find it on your screen, don't worry. It's not hidden behind a labyrinth of choices, or a moral dilemma, or a surprisingly eloquent README. No, it's just there. Stark. Unyielding. A silent, stoic sentinel of simplicity.

You press it. And then, with bated breath, as the milliseconds tick by, as the CPU dutifully processes its colossal payload, it tells you... The Number 8.

Yes, 8. Not 7. Not 9. Not the answer to the universe, life, and everything. Just precisely 8. And, No, there are no hidden achievements. There's no secret, fancy animation after clicking it for 100, 200, or even 1,000 times. No easter eggs for the compulsive clickers among you who might think, “Surely if I press this button a thousand times, something must happen!” No. You’ll get 8. Every time ! This is a profound, groundbreaking experience, echoing the existential dread and hilarious mundanity. This project invites you to question everything you thought you knew about utility, efficiency, and perhaps even reality itself. Why did I build it? Why is it so substantial when it practically does nothing? Why are you still contemplating downloading it, despite the glaring lack of tangible benefit? You didn't ask for it. You didn’t need it. And yet, here you are. You found yourself entangled in a moment of exquisite purposelessness.
